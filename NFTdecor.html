                <h3>Virtual Room Decor dApp</h3>
                <h2>Project Context</h2>
                <p>NFT Decor is a groundbreaking decentralized application (dApp) designed to transform the way NFT collectors display and interact with their digital art. This project aims to create an engaging, social, and customizable space for showcasing NFT collections.</p>
    
                <h2>Project Duration and Tools</h2>
                <p>Date: November 2023</p>
                <p>Duration: 3.5 weeks</p>
                <p>Tools: Figma, Spline, Adobe Photoshop, Google Suite</p>

                <h2>Team Members</h2>
                <p>Jack He - UI/UX Designer</p>
                <p>Mercury Huang - UI/UX Designer</p>
                <p>Frantz Droulliard - UI/UX Designer</p>
                <p>Anthony Mero - UI/UX Designer</p>

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Focusing on building a dApp, NFT Decor serves as a unique social network where users can personalize virtual rooms to exhibit their NFT collections. It bridges art, technology, and social interaction in the NFT space.</p>

                <h3>User's Challenge</h3>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>NFT collectors face challenges in displaying their collections in a unified, interactive space while building social connections within the NFT community.</p>

                <h2>Solution Concept</h2>
                <p>NFT Decor is conceptualized to offer a dynamic and adaptable platform for users to display their NFTs in creative virtual environments, thereby enhancing social engagement and network building.</p>

                <h3>Understanding the Market and Users</h3>
                <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>Our analysis of competitors like Christie's and emerging NFT display apps has sharpened our focus for the NFT Decor project. We found that while some platforms offer excellent display options, they may lack a strong community aspect, which is crucial for NFT enthusiasts. Others might be user-friendly but fall short in integrating social features. With NFT Decor, we aim to fill these gaps by creating a welcoming environment that not only showcases NFTs impressively but also fosters genuine connections among users. By combining the best features from our competitors and addressing their shortcomings, we're crafting an NFT display experience that is both visually stunning and community-driven.</p>

                <h2>Interview</h2>
                <p>We planned and conducted 5 interviews with potential users who owns NFTs. In order to create a social network where users can decorate their room with their personal NFT collection, we analyzed the user pain points and insights.</p>

                <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
                <p>In one-on-one interviews, it became evident that users' primary concern revolved around their desire to showcase their NFTs but lacked a more suitable platform for doing so.</p>

                <h2>Survey Data</h2>
                <p>During our project, we conducted a survey that garnered 12 responses, offering valuable insights into the preferences and behaviors of NFT collectors.</p>
                <h4>Socialization Trends Among Collectors</h4>
                <p>A significant 58% of survey participants indicated they do not socialize with other NFT collectors either online or in real life. Additionally, 25% chose not to answer this question, suggesting a potential gap in social engagement within the NFT community.</p>
                <h4>Preferences for NFT Display</h4>
                <p>When asked about their preferred method of showcasing NFTs in a virtual space, the responses were evenly split. Both displaying NFTs on walls like a gallery and incorporating them as part of a virtual environment received 25% preference, indicating a desire for diverse and creative display options.</p>
                <h4>Desired Features in NFT Art Rooms</h4>
                <p>A notable finding from the survey was that a majority (10 out of 12 respondents) expressed a strong preference for "Interactive displays" in customizable NFT art rooms. This highlights the user's desire for engaging and dynamic features that enhance their experience of interacting with NFTs.</p>

                <h2>Paper Wireframe</h4>
                <p>In the first phase of our NFT Decor project, we created paper wireframes to establish the basic structure of our app. These wireframes outlined the primary functions and the user's path through the app, providing a clear initial concept for our design.</p>

                <h2>UI Style Sheet</h2>
                <p>For the NFT Decor app, our mood board was a creative amalgamation of various UI styles, combining elements of futurism with a cyberpunk aesthetic. The chosen style direction, incorporating "Visual," "Balanced," and "Cyberpunk" themes, resulted in a user interface that is both visually captivating and functionally elegant. This approach integrated futuristic interfaces, minimalistic design elements, and vibrant neon accents, all contributing to a uniquely engaging user experience.</p>
                <p>Our UI Style Adjectives - "Cyberpunk," "Visual," "Balanced," "Futuristic," "Neon Glow," and "Dark Mode" - collectively describe the essence of our design ethos. Each adjective played a pivotal role in guiding the aesthetic decisions, from layout compositions to color schemes and typography.</p>
                <p>Speaking of typography, we chose 'Russo One' and 'Darker Grotesque' fonts for their bold and modern appeal, complementing our app's cyberpunk and futuristic theme. These fonts add a contemporary edge to the app's overall design, ensuring readability and style.</p>
                <p>In our quest for the perfect logo, we explored various designs and finally settled on one that encapsulates the essence of NFT style. This logo not only aligns with our app’s theme but also resonates with the NFT community.</p>
                <p>Our color palette for the NFT Decor app is chosen to not only enhance the app's futuristic and cyberpunk theme but also to ensure optimal accessibility. The selection includes a deep black, vibrant cyan, bright neon green, and soft lavender, balanced with classic white. These colors work together to create a visually appealing experience while passing the AAA accessibility test, ensuring a comfortable and inclusive user experience for everyone.</p>
