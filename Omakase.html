<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Shinpi Omakase, located in Manhattan, is known for its luxurious dining experience, offering chef's choice menus with special, seasonal ingredients. The restaurant operates on an appointment-only basis, catering to an exclusive clientele. Key goals included simplifying the online reservation process, optimizing user engagement to decrease bounce rates, and ensuring the website's design and usability effectively communicated the restaurant's high-end dining experience.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<div class="project-details">

<h2>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<h4>The Shinpi Omakase website redesign project aimed to address several key user experience issues that were hindering the restaurant's online presence.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The website's complex navigation made it difficult for users to find essential information and book reservations.</li>
  <li>A high bounce rate suggested that visitors were not finding what they needed or engaging meaningfully with the site.</li>
  <li>Despite the restaurant's high-end image, the website failed to provide a seamless and luxurious user journey.</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>Conducted targeted interviews to gather immediate insights, revealing key user frustrations with the booking process and site navigation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gathered feedback from 11 users through surveys, focusing on their expectations and experiences.</li>
  <li>Insights used to pinpoint areas for improvement in user interface and reservation process.</li>
  <li>Analyzed user behaviors and preferences on the website, focusing on how they interact with menu presentations and reservation features.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Survey results showed a clear preference for simple reservation methods and visual menus, which guided a redesign focused on straightforward navigation and engaging visual content.</p>

    <h3>Prioritized User Stories:</h3>
    <p>1. As a user, I want a quick, one-click process to make a reservation.</p>
<p>2. As a user, I want to see actual images of the dishes on the menu page. </p>
<p>3. As a user, I want to quickly find the booking section and get all the details I need to make a reservation easily.</p>
<p>4. As a user, I want the contact information to be clearly visible so that I can quickly find directions or get in touch with the restaurant for special requests. </p>

<h3>Initial Feedback and Analysis</h3>
    <p>Gathered feedback from 5 testers on the original website. Common feedback highlighted issues with the homepage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overwhelming layout:</strong> Too much content leading to loss of interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor organization:</strong> Text alignment inconsistencies and cluttered information.</li>
        <li><strong>Font and color issues:</strong> Difficult-to-read fonts and color schemes.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation Difficulties:</strong> The navigation bar was noted to be too small, making site navigation challenging.</li>
        <li><strong>Complicated Booking:</strong> The reservation process was not straightforward, and incorrect information on time slot, presenting a barrier to booking.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Information:</strong> Pages lacked comprehensive details that users were looking for.</li>
        <li><strong>Unnecessary Login:</strong> The requirement to log in was seen as an unnecessary step.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite these issues, one positive aspect was noted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resy Booking:</strong> Testers appreciated with Resy for easy reservations.</li>
    </ul>

      </div>  

  <h3>Key Feature: 'Book with Resy' Button</h3>
  <p>Positioned the booking button at the center of the homepage for high visibility and tested its functionality on various devices for a easy and smooth booking experience</p>
  
  <h3>Tasks Performed During User Testing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Booking a reservation</li>
    <li>Finding reservation details (price, contact info, menu)</li>
    <li>(Additional Task) Reviewing the restaurant's policy on cancellations and no-shows</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Surprising Feedback</h3>
  <p>"I was looking for your cancellation policy and it took me a while. Maybe it should be more visible, possibly near the booking section?"</p>
<p>"I wished the "About Us" page offered more than just text. Maybe something more visual or interactive to really get a feel for the restaurant."</p>

  <h3>Iterative Changes Based on Feedback</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Relocated reservation details and policies to a more user-friendly section on the reservation page, simplifying the booking process.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the About Us page by adding a "View Our Moments" button. This leads to a multimedia gallery showcasing the restaurant's highlights, including social media content and influencer visits. The addition of this feature has led to increased user engagement, with visitors spending more time on the site and a noticeable uptick in social media interactions, positively impacting the brand's perception.</li>

<h3>Improving the Menu Page Engagement</h3>
<p>Despite overall improvements, the menu page saw a 28% decrease in visits which caught our attention.</p>

<h5>Why the Decrease?</h5>
<p>It seems users are getting what they need faster elsewhere on the site, bypassing the menu page.</p>

<h6>My Response</h6>
<p>Based on tester suggestions, I'm experimenting with innovative ways to highlight the menu, such as showcasing key menu items on the homepage.</p>

<h6>What's Happening Now</h6>
<p>The changes I've made, guided by tester feedback, are starting to show a more balanced site engagement. I'm continuously analyzing data, keeping an eye on the stats to guide the next moves.</p>



<h2>Reflections and Future Directions</h2>

<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
<p>The redesign process, guided by user feedback and testing, significantly improved site engagement—page views increased by 51%, and users spent 17% more time on the site, demonstrating the effectiveness of a data-driven approach.</p>

<h3>Impact of Visual Storytelling</h3>
<p>The "View Our Moments" section showed how powerful visuals can enhance user engagement. This approach will be a key feature in my future projects.</p>

<h3>Plans for Future Projects</h3>
<p>I aim to focus on creating more engaging designs and adding deeper content in my next projects. Keeping a close loop with user feedback will be crucial to this process.</p>

<h3>Next Steps for This Project</h3>
<p>I'm planning to incorporate content from our users to enhance the community vibe around the restaurant. Plus, I'll continue analyzing data, ensuring it aligns with how our visitors engage with it. This includes making the menu more prominent based on recent insights, with ongoing adjustments guided by user feedback and analytics.</p>
