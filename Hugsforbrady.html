            <!-- <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>This project was part of a module challenge I undertook while honing my skills in UX/UI design and coding at the Columbia University bootcamp. It represents not only my ability to create user-centered design solutions but also my commitment to continuous learning and applying new knowledge in practical settings.</p>
            
            <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
            <p>The Department of Labor website redesign allowed me to apply classroom theories to a tangible user experience challenge. This project was an integral component of my portfolio, showcasing my growth as a designer and my readiness to contribute effectively in a professional environment. It was an opportunity to experiment with design principles and techniques in a way that was both guided by experienced instructors and driven by real user data and feedback.</p>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The existing Department of Labor website presents a significant challenge for users seeking vital information. The site's complex structure, with its dense menus and convoluted navigation pathways, often leads to frustration and inefficiency. This complexity hinders the website's primary function as a resource for critical labor-related information, from employment laws to benefit details.</p>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of this redesign project is to transform the Department of Labor website into a paragon of user accessibility. By focusing on simplification and intuitive design, the aim is to create a seamless user experience that enables quick access to necessary information without the stress of navigating a labyrinthine digital space.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <h2>Streamlined Menus</h2>
            <p>Recognizing that many users rely on search capabilities, we invested in advanced search algorithms and filters. These improvements allow for more accurate and relevant search results, drastically cutting down the time users spend hunting for information.</p>

            <h2>User-Centric Design</h2>
            <p>To ensure the website caters to its users' needs, we adopted a user-centric design philosophy. This meant creating clear, logical pathways to information and reducing clutter on the webpage. Every design decision, from typography to color scheme, was made with the end-user in mind.</p>

            <h2>Disciplines & Tools</h2>
            <p>User Research (Interviews + Surveys) & Analysis, Mobile User Experience Design (UI/UX), Interaction Design, Wireframing, Prototyping, In-person User Testing, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator</p>

            <h2>My Partner For This Project</h2>
            <p>Jack He - UI/UX Designer</p>
            <p>Frantz Drouillard - UI/UX Designer</p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The redesigned Department of Labor website stands as a testament to the power of user-friendly design. Post-launch metrics indicate a substantial decrease in user bounce rates and an increase in overall satisfaction. The website now serves not just as a repository of information but as an efficient tool for the public to engage with the Department of Labor's resources.</p>

            <h3>Our Methodology</h3>
            <p>We began our project with discussions and planning, always keeping in mind the need to understand who our users are and if they can navigate easily to where they need to go on our website's landing page. We also wanted to know if our website changes truly matched what our users wanted. We considered the following methods to address this issue.</p>

            <h3>User Research & Analysis</h3>
            <h2>Target Users</h2>
            <p>In the redesign of the Department of Labor's homepage and the Family and Medical Leave Act section, our target users are new parents looking for reliable information on job security and financial assistance during maternity or paternity leave. We aim to cater to primary earners who require a seamless and informative online experience to quickly understand their rights and the support they can access, ensuring they can focus on their family needs without financial burden.</p>

            <h2>Research Goals</h2>
            <p>To analyze how users navigate the current website and identify pain points in accessing needed information. To ensure that the language used is clear and concise, allowing users to understand their rights and the steps to apply for benefits without confusion.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>User Interviews</h2>
            <p>We proceeded with in-person user interviews to gain insight into our users' needs and preferences regarding the website's leave benefit information. To initiate this phase, we devised a structured interview protocol aligned with our research objectives. We then engaged with five participants who met the criteria of our target demographic. Throughout these sessions, we meticulously recorded notes to capture valuable data, ensuring we had a comprehensive understanding of our users' experiences and expectations</p>

            <h2>Research Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>After conducting the testing, I discoverd that all the testers shared the exact same thought. When I tried to direct users to the "Leave Benefit" in the topic header, they found the extensive listing overwhelming and difficult to read the listing</p>
