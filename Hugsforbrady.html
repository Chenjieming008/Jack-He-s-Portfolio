                <h2>High Fidelity Prototype (Mobile)</h2>

                <h3>User Research and Analysis</h3>
                <h2>Proto Persona & Storyboard</h2>
                <p>Introduction of proto personas created to guide the redesign, supported by storyboards that helped visualize the user journey and the emotional connection with the website.</p>

                </div>

                <p>We thought about who would use Hugs for Brady's website, focusing on parents experiencing what the founders went through with their child, Brady. This led us to create Monica Silvia, initially imagined as someone seeking support. However, our research showed that a more fitting user would be someone aligned with Hugs for Brady’s goal of raising funds and awareness for childhood cancer. Meet Monica Summers, our revised user persona. Monica, deeply empathetic and altruistic, lost her brother to cancer as a child. This experience motivated her to help children, volunteering and donating to causes like childhood cancer. We believe Monica perfectly represents the target user for our redesigned website.</p>

                <h2>Competitor Analysis and Card Sorting</h2>
                <p>Brief mention of these methods used in the research phase, highlighting how they informed the design decisions and contributed to a more effective user experience.</p>

                </div>

                <p>In our research, we looked at well-known organizations like Make-A-Wish Foundation. Compared to Hugs for Brady, they had more modern websites with better layout and clearer information, plus engaging colors and designs. We saw that we could improve Hugs for Brady's site by organizing donation options and menus more clearly, avoiding confusion and repetition found in the current layout.</p>

                <h2>UI Style Tile</h2>
                <p>The UI Style Tile was a crucial component of our design process. It encapsulated the color scheme, typography, and interface elements that define the visual identity of the redesigned website. This style guide ensured consistency across all design elements, aligning with Hugs for Brady’s mission and brand values.</p>
